# Apache, PHP and Bash/ZSH (And autocomplete)

This project extents the great work of the team **[thecodingmachine](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/docker-images-php)**, with their great work with PHP.

I've added some extended functionality for usability's sake:

- Autocomplete on Bash for repetitive tasks
  
- ZSH, the default Mac's shell
  
- Oh-my-ZSH with plugins enabled like git, debian, ubuntu, laravel, symfony, node, npm and others.
  
- Autocomplete for ZSH
  
- And, for extra flair, I've added some aliases of my own that are to be documented here.
  

Other than that, the image is exactly the same from the original creators.
